      <stem><![CDATA[<p style="">A student is writing a story for his English class about being late for school one day. Read the beginning paragraphs from the story and complete the task that follows.</p><p style=""><br />This morning, I woke up late. My alarm clock never <span id="item_1701_TAG_5" class="its-tag" data-tag="word" data-tag-boundary="start" data-word-index="1"></span>went off<span class="its-tag" data-tag-ref="item_1701_TAG_5" data-tag-boundary="end"></span>! The only reason I woke up at all was because I heard my dog barking. I walked down the hall to my mother's room to find she was still in bed. <span id="item_1701_TAG_2_BEGIN">“Mom! Wake up,”</span> I yelled. <span id="item_1701_TAG_3_BEGIN">“I think we both overslept.”</span> I looked over at the clock and it was 7:30 a.m. School starts in one hour <span id="item_1701_TAG_1_BEGIN">–</span> great!</p><p style=""><br /> I ran into the bathroom. There, I brushed my teeth, washed my face, and then looked in the mirror. My hair was standing straight up! I combed it down with water as fast as I could.</p><p style=""><br /> After that, I threw on some clothes and shoes. Racing into the kitchen, I grabbed my backpack from the table and an apple from the fruit bowl. <span id="item_1701_TAG_4_BEGIN">“Bye, Mom!”</span> I yelled as I pushed through the screen door letting it <span id="item_1701_TAG_7" class="its-tag" data-tag="word" data-tag-boundary="start" data-word-index="3"></span>slam<span class="its-tag" data-tag-ref="item_1701_TAG_7" data-tag-boundary="end"></span> shut behind me.</p><p style=""><br />As I ran for the sidewalk, I watched the bus pull away from the curb and turn down the next street. Soon it was out of sight.</p><p style=""><br />In one or two paragraphs, write an ending to the story that follows from the events and experiences in the story.</p>]]></stem>

            <samplecontent><![CDATA[<p style="">I ran like lightning to school. Thankfully my school was only a half mile from my house. On the way, I tore into my apple with a loud “CRUNCH!.” It took me about five minutes to get there, and I was breathing like a dog on a hot summer day. Even though I was tired I was so happy that I made it on time to school…with one minute to spare. That was close!</p>]]></samplecontent>
