Congress passed Carter's Public Utility Policies Act in 1978, giving tax credits to homeowners who install solar energy cells in their home. The Energy Tax Act encouraged homeowners to invest in energy conservation by giving them a tax credit of up to $2,000 for home solar devices installed after April 20, 1977.</p><p style="">&#xA0;</p><p style="">Today, these solar cells are primarily used to heat water in the home. When sensors attached to the water tank detect that water temperatures are too low, the water is circulated in pipes where heat absorbed by solar energy is transferred to the water. This requires an array of solar panels attached to the home's roof. Initial cost of these panels is quite high, but the money saved through tax credits and monthly energy bills make it a plausible option.</p><p style="">&#xA0;</p><p style="">Affordable hot water is a herald of progress; it is hoped that solar energy will soon provide all power a homeowner needs. Dennis Hayes, executive director of the Solar Energy Resource Institute, recently said, "Solar power will offer the United States a clean energy future, decrease our dependence on petroleum, and offer a decentralized approach to solving our energy problems." With added advantages, the cost of a residential-use solar system will certainly go down, giving the people of the United States a cost-effective way to power their homes.</p><p style="">&#xA0;</p><p style=""><span style="font-style:italic; ">Energy Digest</span>, November <span id="passage_3712_TAG_4_BEGIN">2003</span></p><p style="font-weight:bold; ">&#xA0;</p><p style="font-weight:bold; ">What Happened to Solar Power for Home Use?</p><p style="">by Richard <span id="passage_3712_TAG_5_BEGIN">Mueller</span></p><p style="">&#xA0;</p><p style="">A 1979 poll in <span style="font-style:italic; ">The New York Times</span> indicated that 42% of Americans believed solar energy would solve all of the country's energy problems by 1984. President Carter set a goal in his Proposed Energy Policy that solar energy would be used in 2.5 million homes by 1985. Carter's Public Utilities Policies Act in 1978 and the enormous tax credits that went along with it fueled these ideas.</p><p style="">&#xA0;</p><p style="">At the time, energy costs were skyrocketing due to the oil embargo of 1973. Citizens were looking for alternatives to petroleum for power and fuel, and solar energy became a focal point. It was clean and inexpensive, not to mention safe. The disasters of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl during the 1980s scared people away from nuclear energy, and the influx of solar systems in residences began. However, the popularity of solar power waned by the 1990s. Carter's tax credits ended in 1986 when President Reagan chose to let commerce dictate the direction of renewable energy sources.</p><p style="">&#xA0;</p><p style=""><span id="passage_3712_TAG_10" class="its-tag" data-tag="word" data-tag-boundary="start" data-word-index="5"></span>Simultaneously<span class="its-tag" data-tag-ref="passage_3712_TAG_10" data-tag-boundary="end"></span>, petroleum prices dropped significantly, further <span id="passage_3712_TAG_7" class="its-tag" data-tag="word" data-tag-boundary="start" data-word-index="1"></span>crippling<span class="its-tag" data-tag-ref="passage_3712_TAG_7" data-tag-boundary="end"></span> the solar power industry. By 2000, the costs of installing and maintaining a set of <span id="passage_3712_TAG_9" class="its-tag" data-tag="word" data-tag-boundary="start" data-word-index="4"></span>residential<span class="its-tag" data-tag-ref="passage_3712_TAG_9" data-tag-boundary="end"></span> solar cells were too high, and home use <span id="passage_3712_TAG_8" class="its-tag" data-tag="word" data-tag-boundary="start" data-word-index="3"></span>dwindled<span class="its-tag" data-tag-ref="passage_3712_TAG_8" data-tag-boundary="end"></span>. Neither Carter nor the citizens of the late 1970s were right. Solar power is not used in over two million homes. It has not solved the country's energy problems. Harnessing the sun was a romantic idea that simply was not realistic.</p><p style="">&#xA0;</p><p style="">It may be possible that, in the future, we will revisit the idea of using renewable energy sources like the sun to power our homes, businesses, and perhaps even our cars. For now, though, fossil fuels continue to be the cheapest and most efficient energy source.</p>]]></stem>
